# Imbalanced-Dataset

An imbalanced dataset has unequal distribution of classes, potentially causing biased model performance towards majority classes.

# Technique to handle imbalanced dataset

1.  Resampling methods (oversampling minority, undersampling majority)
2.  SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
